# these are dictionaries for larger datasets,key-value pair
# k is the key
# h(k)=i which is the index, look at it like f(x)=y
# we store the value of the key in the i index
# time constant O(1)

'''Applications of Hash Table
Hash tables are implemented where

constant time lookup and insertion is required
cryptographic applications
indexing data is required'''
